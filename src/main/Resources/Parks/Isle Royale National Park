The largest island in Lake Superior is a place of isolation and wilderness. Along with its many
shipwrecks, waterways, and hiking trails, the park also includes over 400 smaller islands within
4.5 miles (7.2 km) of its shores. There are only 20 mammal species on the island, though the
relationship between its wolf and moose populations is especially unique.
