Five of the eight Channel Islands are protected, with half of the park's area underwater. The
islands have a unique Mediterranean ecosystem originally settled by the Chumash people. They
are home to over 2,000 species of land plants and animals, 145 endemic to them, including the
island fox. Ferry services offer transportation to the islands from the mainland.
