This park on the Olympic Peninsula includes a wide range of ecosystems from Pacific shoreline
to temperate rainforests to the glaciated alpine peaks of the Olympic Mountains, the tallest
of which is Mount Olympus. The Hoh and Quinault Rainforest are the wettest areas in the
contiguous United States, with the Hoh receiving an average of almost 12 ft (3.7 m) of rain
every year.
