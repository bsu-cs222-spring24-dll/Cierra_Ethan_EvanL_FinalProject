This park protecting four lakes near the Canada–US border is a site for canoeing, kayaking,
and fishing. The park also preserves a history populated by Ojibwe Native Americans, French
fur traders called voyageurs, and gold miners. Formed by glaciers, the region features tall
bluffs, rock gardens, islands, bays, and several historic buildings.
