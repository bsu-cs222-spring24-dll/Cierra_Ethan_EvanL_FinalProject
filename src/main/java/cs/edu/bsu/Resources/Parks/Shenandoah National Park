Shenandoah's Blue Ridge Mountains are covered by hardwood forests that teem with a wide variety
of wildlife. The Skyline Drive and Appalachian Trail run the entire length of this narrow park,
along with more than 500 miles (800 km) of hiking trails passing scenic overlooks and cataracts
of the Shenandoah River.
