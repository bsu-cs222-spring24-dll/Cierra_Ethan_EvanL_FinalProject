Based around Nevada's second tallest mountain, Wheeler Peak, Great Basin National Park protects
5,000-year-old bristlecone pines, a rock glacier, and the limestone Lehman Caves. Due to its
remote location, the park is home to some of the country's darkest night skies. Wildlife
includes the Townsend's big-eared bat, pronghorn, and Bonneville cutthroat trout.
