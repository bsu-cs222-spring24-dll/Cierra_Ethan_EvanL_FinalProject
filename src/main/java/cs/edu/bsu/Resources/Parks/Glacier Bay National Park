Glacier Bay contains tidewater glaciers, mountains, fjords, and a temperate rainforest, and
is home to large populations of grizzly bears, mountain goats, whales, seals, and eagles. When
discovered in 1794 by George Vancouver, the entire bay was covered by ice, but the glaciers
have since receded more than 65 miles (105 km).
