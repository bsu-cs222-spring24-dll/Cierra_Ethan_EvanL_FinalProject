The New River Gorge is the deepest river gorge east of the Mississippi River. The park primarily
covers the lower gorge area around the New River Gorge Bridge, which features some of the
country's best whitewater rafting. Smaller noncontiguous sections showcase the ghost town of
Thurmond, the scenic Grandview vista, and Sandstone Falls. The other 65,165 acres (263.71 km2)
of the redesignated national river is now a national preserve, spanning 53 mi (85 km) of the New
River.
