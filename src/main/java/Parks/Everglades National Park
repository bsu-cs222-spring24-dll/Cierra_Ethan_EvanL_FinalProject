The Everglades Are the largest tropical wilderness in the United States. This mangrove and
tropical rainforest ecosystem and marine estuary is home to 36 protected species, including
the Florida panther, American crocodile, and West Indian manatee. Some areas have been drained
and developed; restoration projects aim to restore the ecology.
