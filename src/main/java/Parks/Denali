Centered on Denali, the tallest and most prominent mountain in North America, the park is
serviced by a single road leading to Wonder Lake, most of which can only be accessed via
scheduled tour buses. Denali and other peaks of the Alaska Range are covered with long glaciers
and boreal forest. Wildlife includes grizzly bears, Dall sheep, moose, caribou, and wolves.
