Split into the separate Rincon Mountain and Tucson Mountain districts, this park is evidence that
the dry Sonoran Desert is still home to a great variety of life spanning six biotic communities.
Beyond the namesake giant saguaro cacti, there are barrel cacti, chollas, and prickly pears, as
well as lesser long-nosed bats, spotted owls, and javelinas.
