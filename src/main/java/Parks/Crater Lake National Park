Crater Lake Lies in the caldera of an ancient volcano called Mount Mazama that collapsed 7,700
years ago. The lake is the deepest in the United States and is noted for its vivid blue color
and water clarity. Wizard Island And the Phantom Ship Are more recent volcanic formations within
the caldera. As the lake has no inlets or outlets, it is replenished only by precipitation.
