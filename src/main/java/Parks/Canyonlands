This landscape was eroded into a maze of canyons, buttes, and mesas by the combined efforts
of the Colorado River, Green River, and their tributaries, which divide the park into three
districts. The park contains thousands of rock pinnacles and arches, as well as artifacts
from Ancient Pueblo peoples.
